Visionary and auteur video game designer, most well known for the Metal Gear series and [[Death Stranding]]. Hideo's games are known for being rich in cinematic storytelling, political-driven, fantastical and strangely omniscient. He pulls heavy inspiration from music, anime, and movies and will often include shoutouts to said influences within his games. Often cited as the inventor of the stealth-combat genre and, to a lesser extend, the creator of a "strand"-genre game which rely on cooperative mechanics from other unseen players.
