# Gjaldskylda Overview

---
Gjaldskylda is the Icelandic word for "payment required" which is often found on parking signs around points of interest, including nature preserves and parks. Sometimes tourists mistake this word for the name of the park or attraction itself. They will take photographs at these parks and then post them on social media with hashtags of #Gjaldskylda . The kicker is that the verbiage for payment parking is often more pronounced, enlarged or embolden compared to the actual name of the sight. 


## Thoughts and Takeaways

Accidentally mythologizing a payment parking sign into the name of a natural monument is so deeply absurd and hysterical, I cant help but to feel something deeper is going on. I am reminded of [[Onomastics in East of Eden]] and the discussion of locations receiving their names, how natives will prescribe descriptive names, conquistadores and colonizers will inject their own mythology blindly, and how sometimes names come from incidences or events at said location. In this case, there is the hapless tourist who is primed to be awe-struck by the ancient sights of Iceland. They walk up and read "Gjaldskylda" and think "wow, *Gjaldskylda*" with a deep respect for the serenity of nature and the local culture. 

In another way, I think about the restoration of [[Ecce Homo]]. A totally insignificant painting undergoes a botched restoration by a local parishioner and her work rockets the original piece to world-wide intrigue. It's another case of mythologizing by accident, a failed attempt at devotion turns a small town in Spain into a tourist destination.

Humans are meaning-making machines, and sometimes machines make mistakes. Sometimes you mistakenly refer to an ancient natural monument as "cash only". Sometimes you touch up a portrait of Jesus Christ and turn him into an entity of surreal agony. In a weird way, money is always involved.
