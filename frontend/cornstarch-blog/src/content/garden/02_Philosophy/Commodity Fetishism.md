#### Definition
The perception that economic relationships of [[production]] and exchange are between things (money, factories, computers, commodities etc.) instead of people. This obscures the social relations that are actually required in the production of a product. 

#### Example
While reading [[The Crying of Lot 49]], Elena explained how jarring it was to see chinese Tik Tok users posting how a nameless factory in China would produce massive swaths of the world's commodities. How you imagine your trinket or clothing with some witty meme on it is just churned out of some automated process, but that isn't the case. There are human hands all along the entire line of interaction.
