"Masculinity is a cage that men walk into every day."

## Definition
Hypermasculinity within Latin American Culture which places a strict patriarchy amongst families and society as a whole. Machismo is expressed and upheld by both men and women and is used to uphold [[Familismo]], or the individual commitment to ones family and faith ([[Divine Femininity]]). This tie to culture and divinity is what makes machismo distinct from tradtional Masculinity.

## Effects on Interpersonal Relationships
#### Child Rearing
Daughters are raised with fear of corruption by the world, vulnerable and sexualized. Interesting since machismo has a branch of sexual virility and thus some aspect of a machistos view of women must be sexual in nature. The father/son relationship tends to be emotionally distant, since machismo values emotional toughness. Sons will grow up trying to attain unattainable levels of masculinity (how much is truly enough?).
#### Sexuality
Heterosexuality is a pillar of machismo upheld by both sexes to varying extents. Sexual virility among men is seen as a positive trait while sexual prowess for women is seen as admonishable if not an inherent danger to themselves. Women are also raised to see sex as a means to child-rearing, or an act of service to their husbands rather than a mutual emotional experience. 

Machistos put [[Homosexuality]] and homosexual men, specifically beneath themselves, but perhaps still above women lest they are flamboyantly gay. It seems like [[Homosexuality|lesbian]] women are held in lowest regards because of their perceived attacks on [[Familismo]], machismo, and thus culture and faith. Homosexuality as a whole is perceived as sinful in catholicism and christianity which removes support structures from queer people. Machistas will use derogatory terms towards men who can't achieve any aspect of machismo as a direct comparison to their perceived lack of masculinity. Men displaying high levels of machismo, have been observed to be 5x more likely to attain HIV or STIs perhaps through secretively homosexual acts.

#### Between Siblings 
Childhood is our chance to bite into nerf balls and put on your parents clothing, feeling out social and cultural mores. Machismo between brothers means competition and shows of strength while being emotionally distant. 

#### Mental Health
