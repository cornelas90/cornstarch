Maxwell's Demon refers to a thought experiment which appears to violate (or disprove) the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. It was invented by James Clerk Maxwell around 1870 and has been debated since.

The thought experiment postulates an intelligent demon who can observe and measure particles in a container. The container is split into two sections with a small door that the demon can control. When faster (i.e. hotter) particles approach the door, the demon quickly opens it and traps it on one side, say, "Side A". When slower particles approach the opposite side-"Side B"-the demon once again allows it through. Once these particles are sorted, Side A would contain more usable energy than it originally had, [[Entropy]] would be reduced, and thus the second law of thermodynamics would be violated. Importantly, Maxwell assumes that the demon's sorting is not [[Work]] and does not require energy to accomplish.

Maxwell's demon plays an important role thematically in [[The Crying of Lot 49]] as Oedipus Maas wanders across California, attempting to reduce informational entropy by investigating a potentially imagined conspiracy.
