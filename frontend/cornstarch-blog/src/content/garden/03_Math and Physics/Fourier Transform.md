A Fourier transform (FT) is an integral transform that takes maps some initial function in the time domain to an output function in its frequency domain. In other words, It will take a signal (function) that changes of time and output the distribution of frequencies present within it. A music analog would be to break down a piano playing a C-chord and mapping out the frequencies that create it (initial octave C E G, with higher octaves and B overtones).

Interestingly, the [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] is born directly out of the mathematical properties of FTs. Generally speaking, concentrated functions will result in broadened frequency-domain functions. Since particles waveforms are described in x-space and momentum-space, both related by a Fourier transform, it follows that concentrating information about a particles position in space necessarily broadens its position in momentum space. This inability to compact both functions is formalized as an an uncertainty principle. See also [[Hirschman Uncertainty Principle]]
