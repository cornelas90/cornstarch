---

Not just a sampler.

**Manual:**
https://www.elektron.se/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Octatrack-MKII-User-Manual_ENG_OS1.40A_210414.pdf
## Concepts

### Set

Basically the entire Octatrack. All audio samples and all subsequent Projects, Banks, Parts, etc.

### Project

One project consists of 16 Banks, 8 Arrangements, 8 Track recorders, etc. 

### Banks

Banks are an organizational subset of their own subsequent patterns, etc.. Each Project has 16 Banks. Each Bank has 16 patterns and 4 partsm

### Pattern

Just like the pattern of any other programmable device, Octatrack patterns hold parameter settings, notes, samples, trigs, etc. They are accessed by pressing PTN and then a Trig button. 

### Part

Kind of analogous to "Kits" and can hold different samples, fx, etc. 

### Scene



### Track

Re: *Audio* Tracks, and thus samples. They are assigned **Machines** which act effectively as input settings.

### Track Parameters

The five buttons below the screen (SRC, AMP, LFO, FX1, FX2) are the Track parameter pages, 5 pages per track.
