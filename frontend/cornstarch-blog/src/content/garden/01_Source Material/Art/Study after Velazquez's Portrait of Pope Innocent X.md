## Description

---
Painted in 1953 by Francis Bacon, the portrait depicts Pope Innocent X screaming in apparent anguish. He is surrounded by an abstract cube and his entire reality seems to be enveloped by folding fabric, like curtains. Traditional red robes are swapped for purple, possibly as a judgement of the wealth held by the Vatican.
