## Description

---

The artist noted "this is the result of two hours of devotion to the Virgin of Mercy”.

The restoration was completed by an 81 year old parishioner who was offended by the flecking original. She said she had permission to restore it but went on holiday before finishing her work. 

There is something so hilarious about the movement of an artists hand being gods own work. Surely, Giménez’ hand belonging to a devout Catholic, was also moved by the divine?

[[Ways of Seeing by John Berger|Ways of Seeing]] discusses a similar transformation of art through human interaction, post-creation. He uses the surprising example of the Mona Lisa which only gained its value through art theft. The piece was stolen for the sole purpose of repatriating the art to Italy from France. In a similar manner, Ecce homo was totally unremarkable until the botched restoration of Giménez. 

The original was never restored, with the botched restoration increasing tourism one hundred-fold.
