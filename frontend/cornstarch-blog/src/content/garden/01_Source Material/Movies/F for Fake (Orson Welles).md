# Quotes

"This is a film about trickery and fraud: about lies."

"The important distinction to make when youre talking about the genuine quality of a painting is not so much whether it's a real painting or fake. Its whether it's a good fake or a bad fake."

"Experts are gods gifts to fakers"

Kipling: "When first the flesh of the newborn sun fell on the green and gold, our father, Adam, sat under a tree and scratched with a stick in the mold. And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart. Till the devil whispered behind the leaves 'its pretty, but is it art?'."

"The value depends on opinion, opinion depends on the experts. Elmyr makes fools of experts., so who's the expert? Who's the faker?"

"Our songs will all be silenced, but what of it? But what of it? Go on singing."

"Art is a lie that makes us realize the truth." - Pablo Picasso
# Notes

>"Experts are gods gifts to fakers"

This is an interesting note. We usually blame the con artists or fakers, but the movie posits that the structures around the faker are truly to blame. The fact that experts are required to imbue value into art, for example, alongside the existence of the commodification of art, are what breathe life into forgeries. There is perhaps nothing inherently wrong with forgeries or replications or duplications. 


> "Is it Art, or is it *rare*?"


Here the movie swings into a discussion of value through rarity rather than genuine nature. Welles quickly mentions kitchen forgeries as a throwaway but there is actually an ongoing conspiracy regarding 'fake fish', where kitchens are buying cheaper fish meat that is indistinguishable from the original it aims to replace. This is incredibly interesting. Does it matter if I eat Salmon, or a fish that tastes just like salmon? No, unless you charge me for salmon when its something much cheaper. 

> "I think art dealers... are crooked"

> "Our songs will all be silenced, but what of it? But what of it? Go on singing."


The monologue around Chartres is perhaps the most important quote for what gives art "value" in a different sense of the word than has been used when discussing its genuine nature. It is value because it was what man is capable of.
