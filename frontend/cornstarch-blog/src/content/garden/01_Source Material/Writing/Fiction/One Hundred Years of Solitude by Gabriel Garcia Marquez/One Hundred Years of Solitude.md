He had written it in Sanskri, which was his mother tongue, and he had encoded the even lines in the private cipher of the Emperor Augustus and the odd ones in a Lacedemonian military code.... Melquiades had not put events in the order of man's conventional time, but had concentrated a century of daily episodes in such a way that they coexisted in one instant."
- 
> "Macondo was already a fearful whirlwind of dust and rubble being spun about by the warath of the biblical hurrican when Aureliano skipped eleven pages so as not to lose time with facts he knew only tooo well, and he began to decipher the instant that he was living, deciphering it as he lived it, prophesying himself in the act of deciphering the last page of the parchments, as if he were looking into a speaking mirror. "

> "... He understood that he would never leave that room, for it was foreseen that the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be wiped out by the wind and exiled from the memory of men at the precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would finish deciphering the parchments, and that everything writte on them was unrepeatable since time immemorial and forever more, because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth."

## Characters

---

### José Arcadio Buendía 
Patriarch of Buendía family and founder of Macondo, a city he dreamt of being a city of mirrors. JAB has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge which manifests in full investment of his efforts and attention behind the inventions and spectacles brought into town by traveling Gypsies. He appears to be very utilitarian, building Macondo to house everyone exactly equally, providing the exact same amount of access to sunlight and water for all inhabitants. JAB's obsession with invention and discovery dovetails with an obsession for exploration in the name of connecting with civilization as he sees it. He initially believes falsely that Macondo is an island, but it is later found out that they connect inland through the swamps which were not explored by the crew. During this exploration, Amaranta is born. He forms a close relationship with a gypsy named Melquíades which serves as a sort of shamanistic advisor to José and the settlement. 

José Arcadio Buendía is described in multiple points as having superhuman strength, requiring tens of men to constrain him, as well a fearless leader which is evident in his stature against the magistrate Don Apolinar Moscot. JAB is caught in the vortex of spirituality and magic versus enlightenment. 

He is married to his cousin Úrsula Iguarán, who fears their incestuous ties could lead to deformed children. Their eldest son is José Arcadio, the middle son is Aureliano Buendía, and their youngest daughter is Amaranta. 

His frequent and deep descents into his quest for knowledge lead him to ignore incredible feats of magic like magic carpets and instead focus on his alchemy. José Arcadio Buendía is eventually driven mad after 'discovering' a perpetual motion machine and needs to be tied to an chestnut tree outside of their home by upwards of 30 men. He begins speaking in tongues which, after the introduction of Father Nicanor Reyna, we discover is actually Latin. He spends the rest of his days tied to this chestnut tree, tended to by his wife Ursula, housed by a hut of large leaves to protect him from the weather. Eventually, José Arcadio Buendía dies and Macondo is met with a rain of yellow flower pedals. 

After his death, José Arcadio Buendía is met by the spirit of the man he killed, Prudencio Aguilar, who he begins a friendly relationship with. He is also known to walk around and effectly haunt his home throughout the rest of the novel. 

### Melquíades
Leading gypsy who introduces Macondo and José Arcadio Buendía to invention, discover, alchemy, and innovations that he brings from the outside world. For the latter years of his life, Melquíades lives with the Buendía family acting as advisor and mentor to both JAB and his son Aureliano. He spends most of his time in the family's alchemy lab with Aureliano. Melquíades is evidently immortal, proving to cheat death at least once before. He does eventually die, bringing death to Macondo for the first time since its settlement. 

### José Arcadio 
First child of José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula Iguarán and given the full name of his father, though the novel shortens his name to distinguish him. José Arcadio from a young age is seen as taking after the strength of his father and being irresistible to women. The novel notes specifically that he has an unusually large penis, a physical trait that is comically mistaken for incestuous deformation when his mother accidentally sees him naked. These traits lead to his sexual relation with Pilar Ternera. Together they have the child Arcadio before José Arcadio runs away with the Gypsies.

After many years, José Arcadio returns to Macondo after experiencing the many facets of the world from adventure to cannibalism. He is a hulking man who comes home and begins a relationship with his assumed sister (unrelated, unbeknownst to them) Rebeca. After being expelled from the Buendía household by the matriarch Ursula, they move to the edge of town where José Arcadio tends land and has an explosively lusty relationship with Rebeca. 

His brother Colonel Aurelian Buendía eventually returns to Macondo as part of his final wish to be executed in his home town by the conservatives. José Arcadio eventually helps free his brother by showing up with a shotgun and running the already disheartened conservative soldiers. Shortly after, José Arcadio is shot by an unknown perpetrator, and his body is found in the center square with no gunshot wound but the unremovable scent of gunpowder. Strangely, the trail of his blood is found to drizzle all the way from the room he was apparently shot within, traveling all the way across town to his childhood home.  

### Colonel Aureliano Buendía 


### Úrsula Iguarán
