### Analysis
Duality is baked into East of Eden from page one, when John Steinbeck begins to describe Salinas Valley with two opposing mountain ranges that reflect the sun in different manners. He describes on set of mountains as dark and brooding versus the other which is bright and fertile. There is perhaps a smaller hint to the authors opinion of good and evil and their ability to ebb and flow when he describes the fertility of the valley, which he describes as coming and goin in generational cycles of about 30 years. As we follow at least three generations of Trasks from Cyrus to Adam and Charles to Cal and Aron, we see a similar waxing and waning of morality.
