### Modernity Versus Superstition

The book opens immediately with a strong contrast between the enlightened industrial west versus the backwards and superstitious lives of those living in the Balkans. Jonathan Harker is a newly-christened lawyer who is pretty directly observing this contrast for us. He talks explicitly about academic past times while also passively describing the area peasants and their beliefs with  a sense of bewilderment.
