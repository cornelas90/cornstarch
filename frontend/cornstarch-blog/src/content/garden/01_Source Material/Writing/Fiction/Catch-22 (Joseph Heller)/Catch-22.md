# Catch-22 Overview

---

**Author:** [[Joseph Heller]]
**Year Published:** 1961
**Genre:** Comedy, Satire, War
**Synopsis:** Catch-22 follows the protagonist Yossarian along with his squadron and commanding officers throughout the western theater of [[World War 2]]. The book explores the absurdity and paradoxes that surround war and nationalism by blurring the lines between tragedy and farce, sacred and profane, and logic and absurdity. The novel is so successful in exploring these paradoxes, that using the phrase [[Catch-22 (Logic)|Catch-22]] has permanently entered the American lexicon.

## Chapter Notes

---

### Chapter 1: The Texan
The story starts with our protagonist, Yossarian, found in a hotel being treated for something "just short of jaundice", which is apparently a ploy he has cooked up to avoid wartime. Another soldier named Dunbar is pulling a similar ruse. Yossarian is tasked with censoring letters before they are sent home, and does so flippantly and with made up rules (romance words only, "death to all modifiers"). He censors these letters under the name Washington Irving (Writer of Rip Van Winkle and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow). At this time, a character named The Texan is admitted into the hospital, who has patriotic views which are mocked openly by the other patients. Despite being described as "good-natured, generous, and likable", all patients seem sick of the Texan immediately. They blame him for the death of a comically injured patient who is wrapped like a mummy and taken care of around the clock by nurses. The narrator explains a short story of a fire breaking out at one branch of the hospital that is nearly snuffed by firefighters before being interrupted by the landing of military airplanes which take priority in case of crash landings. The planes land safe, and the original fire snuffs itself out after having nothing left to burn. Finally, the chapter wraps back around to the beginning by depicting a conversation between the chaplain and Yossarian. Despite Yossarian loving the chaplain, he talks him in circles and acts outlandish as if to tease the chaplain. The chapter ends with all soldiers in the ward leaving because of the Texan. 
#### Chapter 1 Notes
- The book starts off with strong absurd, contradictory, and redundant dialogue. Considering the titular 'catch' at hand, I would say this is definitely setting the proper tone. 
- Nobody thinks what they ought to think, they don't really say what they mean, or mean what they say. 
- Yossarian being a censor with a pen name is a great microcosm of the hopelessness of getting across your true intentions. 

### Chapter 2: Clevinger
Yossarian is depicted early in chapter 2 as being the only soldier who really fully grasps what the war is about, telling Clevinger that "they are trying to kill me" to which Clevinger replies "They're shooting at *everyone*!" We are also introduced to Yossarian's tent-mate, a man named Orr, who has installed running water and other permanent fixings to their tent. Their tent is found next to Havermeyer, a man who shoots field mice for fun. Next to them is McWatt and Nately (previously Clevinger). Another character named Appleby is introduced. He is a ping-pong prodigy and is said to "Believe in God, Motherhood, and the American Way of Life, without ever thinking about any of them, and everybody who knew him liked him". Of course, yossarian does not like him. Yossarian explains to Clevinger that he is still alive because he is basically untouchable, describing himself as [[Cain and Abel|Cain]]... Tarzan... Lot of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]... and "[[Sweeney Among the Nightingales]]" (poem by [[T.S. Eliot]]
). and finally "Supraman". Note: Supra (Latin for "above") is an academic and legal citation signal used when a writer desires to refer a reader to an earlier-cited authority. Clevinger diagnoses Yossarian with a handful of statements that by parts paint him as paranoid, but combined simply state he is at war. The chapter ends with the number of missions required to be flown from 45 to 50, of which Yossarian has 44.

#### Chapter 2 Notes:
I'm not quite sure what to make of Yossarian's bizzare collections of analogies, everything from a Tarzan to Lot of Sodom, it seems totally meaningless.
### Chapter 3: Havermeyer
The chapter opens with an enigmatic person known as "the dead man" in Orr's tent, whom Yossarian cannot get Sergeant Towser to admit does not exist. To me, it is not clear if this is literally a corpse, a figure of speech, or a hallucination, mainly due to the weakening of words already done in this novel. Orr begins to tell a bizarre, nonsensical story about keeping crab apples in his cheeks because they fit better than chestnuts and because he wanted apple cheeks. This story is interrupted by a story of Orr getting beaten with a shoe by a whore. At this time a USO troupe is sent by General P. P. Peckem (described as a prick) to regain frivolous control over infantrymen. We find out that the men know Colonel Carthcart to arbitrarily increase the number of flights required before dismissal. Hungry Joe is also known to only be content when these flights are increased, having screaming nightmares when leave approaches. The main USO troupe member is Colonel Cargill who was a notoriously bad marketing executive who would be hired by companies so they could scapegoat him for tax write-offs, who orders the squadron to go to a U.S.O show. Doc Daneeka wallows in self-pity to Yossarian about how the war uprooted his own successful career, suggesting he should have a better attitude like Havermeyer. Yossarian recounts that Havermeyer is a bombardier who never takes evasive action in his flights but is successful in bombing all of his targets. This is in contrast to Yossarian who only flies to make it back home alive, leaving behind, as the narrator calls it, [[Sturm und Drang]] not knowing the success or failure of their mission. The chapter ends with an anachronistic amalagmation of details surrounding a shootout that Havenmeyer has with field mice, Hungry Joe has with Havenmeyer, and Milo Minderbinder the mess hall cook, has with the squadron, apparently. 
#### Chapter 3 Notes
- This chapter does a lot of tone setting as far as anachronistic storytelling goes between the deadman in the tent, whom we are not sure of his story, and a mostly unknown character, Milo Minderbinder whom has apparently caused friendly fire. 
- The book is also beginning to highlight bureaucracy as an inherently contradictory concept, with Generall P. P. Peckem's overreach leading to the introduction of a notorious fall-guy being assigned to fix up the squadron.

### Chapter 4: Doc Daneeka

Hungry Joe and Youssaian think each other are crazy. The latter gives advice to the former who will not listen because of this fact. After a short talk with Doc Daneeka, it is explained that Yossarian used to disrupt educational meetings Clevinger held in Captain Black's intelligence tent. H remembers them as "good questions", as the memory is kicked off, but they end up being unintelligible, unanswerable questions. This leads to Colonel Korn developing a rule akin to catch-22, that people who do not ask questions are allowed to ask questions. The program is discontinued as the Colonel determines that people who do not question anything cannot be educated. We learn that the squadmates shoot skeet together: Yossarian never hits and Appleby never misses. A funny miscommunication happens in a bureaucratic miscommunication in which ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen simply says [[T.S. Eliot]] into a phone and hangs up, spurring military members to wonder if this is some sort of coded language. It is, in reality, an answer to a hypothetical posed by Colonel Cargill about poets who make money. Dunbar shoots skeet because he hates it, and believes being bored will lengthen his life via slowed perception of time

#### Chapter 4 Notes
- Doc Daneeka reminds me very much of Dr Hilarious from [[The Crying of Lot 49|The Crying of Lot 49]], a spazzed out doctor with shady ethics despite their career's prestige. 

### Chapter 5: Chief White Halfoat
Yossarian vitist Doc Daneeka's tent where Doc explains his career before the war as a corrupt physician who would funnel patients to druggist friends. The describes an utterly hilarious interaction between himself and a newlywed couple he has taken on as patients who apparently don't know how to have sex. He takes to explaining it by having the husband pantomime intercourse between two sex toys. After this, Chief White Halfoat, a native man, describes his pre-war life in which he was used as "human divining rods" for oil barons, which followed him and his people across the nation, drilling exactly where ever it was they decided to set up camp. This chase began to get so ahead of itself that eventually they would be displaced before they could even set up. The next section explains to us the famous Catch-22 a regulation that states, in order to be grounded for insanity, a pilot must ask to be grounded; but any pilot who asks to be grounded must be sane, since sane people would never want to fly bombing missions. Yossarian is impressed with this catch, comparing it to modern art which he cannot understand until he defocuses. He also believes Orr about flies in Applebys eyes, which prevent Appleby from seeing the flies in his eyes (another paradox). Next Yossarian remembers how on missions he would beg McWatt to avoid antiaircraft missiles , and wishing he were in charge of the evasive maneuvers. He thinks to himself how he could not trust any other pilot to evade the enemy fire because none are as fearful as him. The co-pilot Dobbs goes crazy, screaming "Help him" as the plane spins out of control. Strangely, the chapter ends with a death of a character named Snowden who dies in the back of the plane at this time. 

#### Chapter 5 Notes
- There is a tinge of historical analysis being done with Chief White Halfoat's character, pointing the finger back at ourselves and our transgressions against the native people. 
- The explanation of Catch-22 serves as our north star through a lot of the paradoxical, circular language of the book.
- The death of Snowden is a strong hint at the anachronistic nature of the book and mystery to come. Is Snowden the deadman from Orr's tent? Was he already dead? Or was he being referred to as dead with the weird prophetic storytelling of the book? 

### Chapter 6: Hungry Joe
Hungary Joe has surpassed his 50 flights but is not relieved from duty. He has night terrors while he awaits a new scheduling of flight or increase in the total number needed before dismissal. He tries to trick women into taking scandelous photographs by telling them he works for LIFE magazine, which he did truly work for before the war. The photos never turn out for myraid of reasons. Colonel Carthcart raises the number of required flights with every flight Hungry Joe takes which subside his terrors. Colonel Carthcart is called brave for volunteering his men on the most dangerous missions. Appleby gets his ass beat by Orr after Apply wins 5 serves of ping-pong straight against him. Chief White Halfoat breaks the nose of Colonel Moodus who is related to General Dreddle, the latter of which puts the chief on retainer to break his son-in-law's nose on demand. The chapter ends with Ex-P.F.C Wintergreen increasing the number of flights in another catch-22, that Yossarian must obey these new orders regardless of the original number of flights

#### Chapter 6 Notes

### Chapter 7: McWatt
McWatt is Yossarian's pilot and is described, possible a first in the novel, as totally sane and cherry despite the war. Yossarian, as always, contradicts the narrators descriptor and finds him to be the craziest white boy of all time. Yossarian receives a doctors order to receive as much fruit as he would like and shows it to Milo who cannot believe he is allowed cart blanche to the item, pointing out that the card doesn't even say he needs to eat the fruit. Yossarian does not eat the fruit either, in hopes of keeping his liver in a perpetual state of not-quite-jaundice. Milo then tries to convince Yossarian to sell the fruit for profit on the black market. Milo then tells of his dream to serve world-class food in the mess halls. Here we learn about the aforementioned mess hall poisoning, which was done by Corporal Snark, who mashed up soap bars into their sweet potatoes to prove a point about the bad quality of their food. The GI's eat as much as possible because of its taste. We also learn that Milo is anxious about the C.I.D going around asking for a man called Washington Irving (Yossarian) which has been a forged name upon censored letters. Milo is afraid he is being investigated for selling things on the black market, and then describes his dream of turning the squad into a syndicate. He tries to explain what is effectively extortion as if it were patent economics. 

#### Chapter 7 Notes


### Chapter 8: Lieutenant Scheisskopf
Clevinger is described as a genius whom attended Harvard, but nonetheless is a dope who is not respected by either side of politics, and was against bigotry out of personal comfort (sounds familiar). They were trained under Lieutenant Scheisskopf who was obsessed with parades and had a cheating wife named Dori Duz who "did" everyone under his command. Yossarian falls in love with her and frequently has sex with her. Scheisskopf comes up with a way to win the parade contests by shortening the amount his men move their arms. Scheisskopf resents smart men and sends Clevinger to a trial for being belligerent. The trial is a totally absurd interaction in which Clevinger cannot say anothing right, even when he says everything right. Clevinger comes to realize his superiors hate him more than the enemies who want him dead. 

#### Chapter 8 Notes
A substantial amount of time is taken to describe the ridiculous thought process behind the parade and behind Clevinger's kangaroo court. The chapter really focuses on bureaucratic hang-ups and vendettas that drive the senior-ranking officials decisions, none of which are aligned with the war. In fact, as we reach about an eighth of the way through the novel, war has been mostly auxillary and almost a nuisance to these men's power trips rather than a moral obligation to stop fascism.  


### Chapter 9: Major Major Major Major
We start with an uncharacteristic flashback for Major Major's chapter, in which we learn that he is given his odd name because of his father's strange sense of humor, lying to his wife that his name is Caleb Major, foregoing other pun-shaped names like C-Major or Drum Major, and instead opting for the redundant naming of Major Major Major (first, middle, and last name). Importantly, Major Major also bears resemblance to actor [[Henry Fonda]]. Generally, he is described as having an almost accursed life. 

>Major Major had been born too late and too mediocre. Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three.

We then  learn a little more about Major Major's father who was "... a god fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding, rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism." In typical fashion of the book, this narrative descriptor is immediately undercut by the description of a scheme his father holders in which the government pays him for poor crop yields of alfalfa. He then uses these subsidies to buy more land to increase the deficit of poor crop yields. With this "success" brought people requesting his help, sort of like an anti-[[Samuel Hamilton]]. 

Major major is promoted to Major by an IBM machine on his first day in the military despite the FBI suspecting him of being a communist (because he did so well in school). He is then assigned to Yossarian's squad in Pianosa where Colonel Carthcart makes him squadron commander, squashing his short-lived happiness. 

> Major Major floundered bewilderedly from one embarrassing catastrophe to another. Without consulting him, Sergeant Towser had his belongings moved into the roomy trailer Major duluth had occupied alone, and when major Major came rushing breathlessly into the orderly room to report the theft of his things, the young corporal there scared him half out of his wits by leaping to his feet and shouting "*Attention!*" the moment he appeared. Major Major snapped to attention with all the rest in the orderly room, wondering what important personage had entered behind him. Minutes passed in rigid silence, and the whole lot of them might have stood there at attention till doomsday if Major Danby had not dropped by from Group to congratulate Major Major twenty minutes later and put them all at ease. 

Throughout the chapter there are many miscommunications surrounding his rank with respect to others leadership. With Lieutenant Scheisskopf, they cannot determine whom needs to say "sir" to whom. With Major ----- de Coverley, an revered old major who plays horseshoes all day, he "could not decide whether... he was blessed with a lenient superior or cursed with a delinquent subordinate". 

Out of boredom, Major Major begins signing official documents with Yossarian's "Washington Irving" pen name (and later as [[John Milton]], author of Paradise Lost). We learn through one of these documents that the deadman in Yossarian's tent was a second lieutenant who had been assigned to Pianosa but died before he arrived. Sergeant Towser decides to treat him as vanishing into thin air, perhaps for convenience. Later, a C.I.D man interrogates Major Major over the increased volume of Washington Irving forgeries and they humorously discuss the culprit in a series of paradoxes before the C.I.D man runs off to the mess hall to track a possible suspect. Shortly after, another C.I.D man enters Major Major's office, suspecting the first C.I.D man of being such a hack that he may be involved in the scandal. The first C.I.D man comes back to investigate the second man, and they go back and forth before leaving for good. 

In a sad turn, Major Major begins wearing a Groucho Marx disguise to continue playing basketball with his old friends. For a moment, he believes the disguise works until the players become so violent they begin to simply beat him. He leaves defeated, and sobs to himself in his office. This depression leads Major Major to demand he only take visitors when he is gone for the day (another catch-22), of which Yossarian immediately defies in demands of being grounded. Major Major tells him there is nothing he can do. 

>*What could you possibly say to him?* Major Major wondered forlornly. One thing he could not say was that there was nothing he can do. To say there was nothing he could do would suggest he *would* do something if he could and imply the existence of an error or inustice in Colonel Korn's policy. Colonel Korn had been most explicity about that. He must never say there was nothing he could do. 
>"I'm sorry," he said. "But there's nothing I can do."


 
#### Chapter 9 Notes
* These older books have one interesting through-line: they readily describe characters philosophically as a way to quickly, thoroughly flesh out characters. Major Major's dad being a Calvinist as to assign misfortune to God's will, tells us a lot about his misanthropic tendency. 
* The IBM promotion feels AI coded, imagine asking ChatGPT what rank a man named "Major Major Major" ought to have. 
* This chapter is choc full of really classic mid-century humor, with a turn towards a very tragic character development 

### Chapter 10: Wintergreen
Clevinger is assumed dead as his plane is lost off the coast of Elba though Yossarian seems to believe this was a desertion akin to a mass disappearance of a whole barracks of men called "The Great Conspiracy of Lowery Field". Excited by this prospect, Yossarian talks to Ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen who himself frequently went AWOL, be punished with the task of digging holes, fill them back up, and then go AWOL again once he finished his task. During this digging he accidentally nicks a water pipe, but it is assumed to be oil perhaps because Chief White Halfoat was on base. The men begin rabidly digging for oil, leading to Ex-P.F.C Wintergreen and Chief White Halfoat being kicked off base. 

Yossarian recalls a soldier named Mudd who died before he ever reported for duty. The narration relates this to forthcoming siege of Bologna and the miasma that encapsulates the encampment upon the learning of this mission. During this time, medical groundings are banned.

#### Chapter 10 Notes
- Joseph Heller is really deftly sliding us out of the surreal nature of war and into the horrors. The last half of chapter 9 and 10 really build a dreadful atmosphere. It's like the comedy and absurdity of the story are the cloudy obfuscation over the true horror of the dark sky that is war and violence. 


### Chapter 11: Captain Black

Captain black learns that Colonel Carthcart has bravely volunteered his men to fly the bombardment mission of Bologna which brings him great job as he hates the men and their squadron commander. Captain Black is described as ambitious and having wanted Major Major's position, which he holds against him. A part of this grudge manifests in the GLOC (Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade) loyalty cards which are forced upon everyone, except Major Major, to sign, to prove they are not communist. This continues until Major –– de Coverley arrives with the demand "Gimme eat! ..Give *everybody* eat!", without signing the cards. Captain Black accepts the end of his pointless charade, reveling in the fear he momentarily caused.

#### Chapter 11 Notes:

- The use of bureaucracy as a cudgel. 
### Chapter 12: Bologna

Before the mission to Bologna can start, a constant raining that oscillates between Pianosa and Bologna begins, and the men pray for the rain to continue. The men begin to watch the map with the mission plans pinned to it as if it will change on its own. Yossarian takes it upon himself to move the bomb line to trick commanding officers into assuming Bologna has been taken by ground forces.

Ex-P.F.C Wintergreen has apparently entered the black market in direct competition with Milo Minderbinder, as he tries to sell Yossarian a lighter. Wintergreen is disgusted to learn that Milo has purchased all of the Egyptian cotton available but cannot sell it. After admitting he moved the bomb line, Yossarian shows a moment of weakness as Clevinger points out that the ground troops are expecting aerial support, but continues supporting his actions anyways. Clevinger asks which is more important, staying alive or winning the war, to which Yossarian replies "To whom? ...It doesn't make a damned bit of difference *who* wins the war to someone who's dead". They then argue about "the enemy", of which Yossarian says is anybody trying to get you killed, and Clevinger says is the enemy established by the government. Shortly after this, we discover Yossarian has given the squad diarrhea in order to keep everyone grounded. 

In a very dizzying passage, Yossarian, Dunbar, and Nately get drunk and joyride with Chief White Halfoat. They discuss the existence of god and the rain. They crash the Jeep and continue to drink before they notice the rain has stopped. The chapter ends with Hungry Joe dreaming of Huple's cat sitting on his face (because it is) and then The men watch the two of them fight against each other, before Hungry Joe goes back to sleep and Huple's cat begins once again to sit on his face. 

#### Chapter 12 Notes
- "...It doesn't make a damned bit of difference *who* wins the war to someone who's dead". This might be one of the most interesting philosophical quandaries of the book so far.
- This chapter establishes Clevinger as a direct foil to Yossarian. 
- The existence of god seems to be a new direction for the book to take. 
- 

### Chapter 13: Major –– de Coverley

Major –– de Coverley is a regal old man who spends most of his time playing horseshoes and traveling abroad to cities captured by Americans (or not) and renting apartments for troops to stay in and kidnapping laborers for upkeep. One of the maids is known for having lime-colored panties, being motherly, and having sex with everyone. Because she is described as impossible to love, Yossarian falls in love with her. Milo Minderbinder is one of the only men who was brave enough to approach the major as he played horseshoes, where he asks for permission to fly out to Malta for fresh eggs for the mess hall. This leads other mess halls being forced to join Milos syndicate for fresh eggs as he corners more world markets. Finally, we learn that Yossarian (when he was brave) got a man named Kraft killed by flying over his target a second time because he would have missed it the first time. He is the only plane who hit the target, and only hit it because of the dangerous maneuver. His superiors feel his actions were reckless and stupid despite its success, and settle on promoting Yossarian to Captain and awarding him a medal to save face.

#### Chapter 13 Notes

- Milo Minderbinder's syndicate grows
- Yossarian responsible for a squadmates death in earlier mission
- blurring of line between courage and stupidity

### Chapter 14: Kid Sampson

In contrast with the previous feat of bravery, Yossarian decides to not fly even once over Bologna. He pretends the intercomm system being helmed by Kid Sampson is broken and orders the flight to turn back. The rest of the chapter is filled with really grotesque, depressing imagery and ambience to reflect an internal remorse the squadron faces as they return to an empty tent, perhaps realizing they've abandoned their men. Yossarian baptizes himself in a nearby lake and falls asleep on a sandbar before being woken up by the return of the rest of the planes which have incurred no loss. He assumes that Bologna had overcast skies and that the mission was postponed but it was in fact a total success facing no losses or even damage. 

#### Chapter 14
- Incredible pivot back into the horror of war
- Yossarian faces an unintended aspect of his sel-preservation philosophy - abandoning his friends. 
- The relief and small tinge of patriotism that may infect us is very troubling


### Chapter 15: Piltchard & Wren

Captain Piltchad and Captain Wren are strangely twinning men who are calm to the point of seeming unserious. Yossarian faces effectively zero repercussions for his abandonment in the first flight across Bologna, and is assigned to fly again. Since the first run was "a milk run", they suspect the second run will be just as easy. Naturally, they are met with much more anti-aircraft munition and suffer losses. Yossarian survives, but fears for the life of his squad mates, specifically Orr. McWatt follows his evasive maneuvers and keeps them all alive, while Aarfy acts in a bizarre, surreal demeanor throughout the flight, perhaps mocking Yossarian for the original intercomm debacle. Orr safely crash lands, and Yossarian heads to Rome to me a woman named Luciana with an "invisible scar". 

#### Chapter 15 Notes
- Another brief chapter that spends its time being disorienting to emulate the air battle.
- Aarfy acts enigmatically, perhaps mocking Yossarian in the life-or-death situation.
- The squad is lulled into a false sense of security and meet significant flak on the second run
- The chapter ends with another paradox of an 'invisible scar' on the new character Luciana.
### Chapter 16: Luciana

Yossarian meets th beautiful italian woman named Luciana at a bar in Rome, and plays a small game of cat and mouse with her over dancing, food and drinks, but not sex since she needs to return home to her mother. The next morning, Luciana visits Yossarian and is disgusted with their living conditions. She cleans his room before sleeping with him. Yossarian falls in love with her and asks her to marry him. A catch-22 back and forth takes place in which she states she cannot marry Yossarian because he is crazy, and he is crazy for wanting to marry her, a non-virgin. Her invisible scar is actually a scar that she just refuses to show, and it is one that was earned during an American bombing. Yossarian asks for her number, which she assumes he will rip apart as soon as she leaves so he may feel like a bigshot who slept with a dime and dumped her. He does exactly this and immediately regrets it. At this moment, we learn that Colonel Carthcart has raised the number of missions to 40, and Yossarian, who has 32 flights, decides to head for the hospital, dumping us right back at the beginning of the book.  

#### Chapter 16 Notes


### Chapter 17: The Soldier in White

Yossarian is in and out of the hospital in an attempt to avoid flight time where he muses on death within and outside the confines of the hospital. The hospital has more just, tidy deaths than the warzone. He also has flashbacks to Snowden's death.

> They did not blow up in mid-air like Kraft or the dead man in Yossarian's tnt, or freeze to death in the blazing summertime the way Snowden had rozen to death after spilling his secret to Yossarian in the back of the plane.
> 	"I'm cold", Snowden had whimpered. "I'm cold."
> 	"There, there," Yossarian had tried to comfort him. "There, there."

We revisit the bandaged soldier who was killed by the Texan in chapter 1, and this time it is posited that there may not even be a man within the bandages, as fluids fill and empty from adjacent vessels at exactly reciprocal rates. Yossarian also posits that that Nurse Cramer killed the soldier in white, as she declared him dead. In this way, the bandaged soldier almost becomes a [[Schrödinger's Cat]]. The soldiers pray the bandaged soldier does not moan because he will not be able to tell when it is night or day, and will moan whenever. The soldiers in the ward begin to discuss the justification and ownership of ailments and death, having someone else's malaria, clap etc. Clevinger brings up [[Hippolytus]], an extant greek play only scrounged together by fragments and echoes off of other texts, perhaps only to bring up fate, as he tells Yossarian that he may have been sent home if he had finished his flights before Colonel Carthcart joined. 

Yossarian and Hungry Joe collect illnesses to fear and the former tells Doc Daneeka to give Hungry Joe chronic illnesses he head about in a magazine. He jokes with Doc Daneeka that he may be sick with an illiness the doctor had never heard of, makes him paranoid, and asks to be grounded.

### Chapter 18: The Soldier Who Saw Everything Twice

Yossarian receives advice from a doctor on how to lie to other doctors to stay grounded, which is where he first get the idea to complain about his liver versus his appendix. He then joins a soldier who should "I see everything twice!" in a very funny scene, only stopping his mimickry when the other patient dies, to which Yossarian responds "I see everything once!". Yossarian plans to spend Thanksgiving at the hospital for its food, but breaks the oath to spend the next Thanksgiving fucking Lieutenant Scheisskopf's wife, which leads to a lengthy back and forth focused on optimism versus pessimism, and then then bene / malevolence of god. Yossarian refers to god as a bungler here, which is very funny. After this Yossarian is dressed in bandages to pretend to be the son of a visiting family, in which his false brother corrects his mother from naming him Giuseppe to Yossarian. They cry together and the father asks him to tell god its not right for men to die so young. 

### Chapter 19: Colonel Cathcart

We find out that Colonel Cathart is a cretinous, jealous man who asks the Chaplain to provide godless prayer to the squadron so they may have tighter flight formations. He is distraught to learn the men pray to the same god and that he listens to them equally. The idea is abandoned when Cathcart realizes they may be punished by god for not including the enlisted men in the prayer. Cathcart notibly has fresh produce in his office in the form of plum tomatoes, likely something having to do with Milo. Lastly, The chaplain mentions growing restlessness surrounding the increasing fight requirements which is ignored. 
### Chapter 20: Corporal Whitcomb

The chaplain runs into Colonel Korn who mocks Colonel Cathcart immediately, guessing exactly why he wanted to speak to the chaplain. he then runs into Corporal Whitcome, the chaplains assistant. He is an atheist and resents the chaplain deeply, believing he is holding him back from his career goals. Despite being assistant to the chaplain, Whitcomb is hostile and apparently sets him up for investigation with a C.I.D man, explaining that the chaplain is suspected of forging Washington Irving on censor papers, which Whitcomb claims to know is the Chaplain's handiwork because Whitcomb himself forged the documents as the Chaplain, signing as Irving. The Chaplain feels helpless to improve anyone's life, "least of all his own".

### Chapter 21: General Dreedle

Colonel Cathcart now has Yossarian! on his shit list, one of many lists developed in this chapter, and wonders how many "Yossarian"s there may be. He notes how strange the name is, and how alike it was to the word subversive, among other wides.

> It was not at all like such clean, crisp, honest, American names as Cathcart, Peckem and Dreedle. 

He goes on to write a list of "feathers in his cap" and "black eyes" to wage how his career is moving. Of these black eyes, Cathcart remembers Yossarian showing up to his medal ceremony naked because his uniform was soaked in Snowden's blood and he swore he would never wear a uniform again. This leads to yet another memory of which Yossarian starts a contagous breakout of moaning "Oooooooh" at the increase of flight requirements coupled with horny thoughts about General Dreedle's curvacious nurse. To re-establish order, Dreedle orders the next man to moan to be killed, and just then Major Danby sets his watch, only to realize nobody was syncronizing with him, a realization he bemoans. He is saved by Colonel Moodus letting his father know that he cannot simply kill anyone he wishes to. The chapter ends with Colonel Korn attempting to impress General Dreedle as a way to surpass Colonel Cathcart, to which Dreedle responds by saying he makes him sick. 


### Chapter 22: Milo The Mayor

Milo's syndicate is growing across the world and he is found to have political power in multiple parts of the world.

### Chapter 23: Natelys Old Man

Nately gets tricked into a philosophical argument with an old man at a brothel.


### Chapter 24: Milo

> 	"Sheer genius. How in the world did you ever think of it?"
> 	"My name is Milo Minderbinder. I am twenty-seven years old."

Milo's syndicate continues to grow in power by promising fresh produce to military leadership, trading planes for produce, and swapping authorities in the process. Milo explains that while colonels may not have authority to send planes around the world, transfering the planes to Milo gives him the authority to do so. He is even able to retrieve goods from behind enemy lines through a system of complicated trades. It is revealed that generally speaking, the men find Milo to be a jerk for taking his role as mess officer so seriously (remember, he wasn't assigned this role). 

Shocked by the seizure of German planes, Milo reprimands Colonel Korn and Cathcart for seizing private property like communists. He claims the bombers, the guns, and then men before their very eyes and escalates the syndicate into international cartel. Notably, Milo refuses to business with Russia. 

A turning point in Milo's business practices occurs as he brokerages a deal akin ot [[Yojimbo]] in which he contracts the American military to bomb a German-held bridge whilst simultaneously contracting with German authorities to defend the bridge with antiaircraft missiles. Milo allows both militaries to use their own resources to carry out the attack, profiting solely from brokering the deal. It is revealed that the attack he allows to happen, and even worsens by tipping off the Nazis, is the reason for the dead man in Yossarian's tent. 

> The connsummation of these deals represented an important victory for private enterprises, he pointed out, since the armies of both countries were socialized institutions. 

Yossarian reprimands Milo for his shady dealings and questions his loyalty, but Milo sees no such problem with his actions. He refers to the germans not as enemies but as "stakeholders", that it was no himself but the syndicate. whom earned the $1000 for the shot-down plane, and reaffirms that his role is to support the stakeholders and syndicate. 

> Milo was stung and made no effort to disguise his wounded feelings. It was a muggy, moonlit night filled with gnats, moths, and mosquitos. Milo lifted his arm suddenly and pointed toward the open-air theater, where the milky, dust-filled beam bursting horizontally from the projector slashed a conelike swath in the blackness and draped in a fluorescent membrane of light the audience tilted on the seats there in hypnotic sags, their faces focused upward toward the aluminized movie screen. Milos eyes were liquid with integrity, and his artless and uncorrupted face was lustrous with a shining mixture of sweat and insect repellent. 

Milo runs into trouble as his purchase of the world's Egyptian cotton proves to be financially destabilizing. Unable to continually leech off the government resources, warehousing fees and a lack of interest in product nearly leads to his syndicate's demise. In a desperate attempt to see green again, Milo brokers a deal with the Germans to bomb his own men in an apocalyptic attack on their base. Colonel Cathcart frantically drives to the control center and accidentally runs into Milo, who shortly gives command to a pilot to continue the attack with strafing maneuvers. At this time, it is revealed that Milo goes public with his enterpise and discloses the massive gains he has realized from the attack.

> He could reimburse the government for all the people and property he had destroyed and still have enough money left over to continue buying Egyptian cotton. Everybody, of course, owned a share. And the sweetest part of the whole deal was that there really was no need to reimburse the government at all. 

> "Frankly, I'd like to see the government get out of war altogether and leave the whole field to private industry."

Doc Daneeka treats people from Milo's attack with the same fervor that he had treated during the Avignon mission, where Yossarian lost his nerve and Snowden died in his arms. The narration suddenly takes us to the aftermath of this mission, and Doc is sedating a presumably traumatized Yossarian with pills and morphine every 12 hours. He tells Doc he is fine, but stops wearing clothing and is found by Milo hiding, still naked, in a tree (symbolic possibly of rebirth, shedding skin). Milo seeks Yossarian out to feed him chocolate-covered cotton, an attempt to offload his Egyptian cotton. Yossarian tells Milo to join him in The [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]] as well as the [[Tree of Life]] before Milo corrects him that the tree is in fact a Chestnut tree (I'm feeling a long-con punchline come on with Orr). 

> "Bribery is against the law... But it's not against the law to make a profit, is it?"


### Chapter 25: The Chaplain

This chapter spends a long time humanizing Chaplain Tappman and delving into his personal life. He has a wife and children whom he nervously imagines in peril every night. He does not have any friends besides Yossarian, but feels he is the butt of a joke with every person he interacts with. He is also experiencing a crisis of faith, questioning all things around him and seeing no humanity anywhere he goes. In an attempt to make some sort of difference, he goes to Major Major to ask if it's true that Colonel Cathcart's men fly more than any other squadron, but gets caught in a cat-and-mouse chase as Major Major has left the Chaplain a note back at his tent. During this back and forth, the chaplain also runs into a Captain Flume, the man who is constantly threatened with a slit throat by Chief White Halfoat, enigmatically asking if the Chief has died of pneumonia yet. Colonel Whitcomb has read his letter and thrown it away, asking if the Chaplain will take his word for it. After coming back a second time, he learns that Whitcomb has been promoted to Sergeant by Cathcart for his letters idea. Cathcart is certain this idea will get him into the newspaper, and offers his mean up to fly another Avignon mission. The chapter ends with General Dreedle first praising the chaplain for spending time with drinkers and gamblers (which Cathcart bungles taking credit for back-to-back), before admonishing him for doing it too often. 

### Chapter 26: Aarfy

Nately falls in love with a whore who does not love him back and will not accept his money. He begs the guys to do something to coax her into hanging out with him, but they do not help. Aarfy (and Yossarian, less intentionally) call her a whore to Nately's chagrin. We are seemlessly transported to a mission in which Yossarian takes flak to the thigh and Aarfy partakes in another surreal and menacing joke upon the dying Yossarian. Mcwatt save Yossarian and gives him morphine. In the hospital, him and Dunbar pretend to be higher ranking members Second Lieutenant Anthony F. Fortiori and Warrant Officer Homer Lumley to scare lower rank men out of their spots in the ward. Nurse Cramer and Nurse Ducket come to reprimand the men, carrying Yossarian off by his ear.

### Chapter 27: Nurse Duckett

Yossarian and Dunbar assault Nurse Duckett as a sort of attempt to appear insane to be grounded. Really gross premise for the chapter. Major Sanderson is introduced into the story to reprimand the two men and to speak to them about their mental state. Some typical comedic banter takes place, discussing depression, bipolar disorder, dreams about sex and fish, and the Major hears enough to make the decision to ground the men. Because of the previous rank swapping, though, A. Fortiori is grounded instead of Yossarian or Dunbar. Yossarian goes to Doc Daneeka to demand he be grounded, to which Doc asks who would be left to fight if all the crazy men were grounded. 

### Chapter 28: Dobbs

With rumors of another Bologna mission, Yossarian revisits Dobbs to discuss the plan of killing Colonel Cathcart. Dobbs is no longer interested because he has his 60 missions flown and has already packed his things. Yossarian assure him that the number of flights will be raised as they always were. (Out of curiosity, I checked the average number of flights flown by the US Airforce. Tours initially started with 25 missions. The average lifespan of a B-17 crewman was 11 missions. In the late war, the mission requirements was raised to 30, and then to 35). While Yossarian is in the hospital, Orr is knocked down and safely lands in a body of water with no injuries to his crew, but their life-vests do not inflate because the carbon dioxide canisters were taken by Milo to make ice-cream sodas in the mess hall. Yossarian hears about Orr's tales of survival from an officer in the ward who explains that Orr fed his wrecked crew mates, navigated, fished, and rowed them with a tiny spoon of an oar. We learn Orr is basically a MacGyver type of character. Later, Yossarian goes back to the tent where Orr is working on the tent's stove, specifically for Yossarian as he says. Yossarian is driven mad by his incessant working on the stove and threatens to murder Orr, a fantasy that Yossarian seems to enjoy. Orr re-ups his enigmatic story about the whore who beat him on the head with her shoe in Rome, but never tells the story, instead asking why Yossarian refuses to fly with him. Yossarian explains that it is because Orr has been shot down on every flight he has flown. Orr suggests enigmatically again that Yossarian demand to be flown with Orr, and this time Yossarian feels Orr is subtly trying to tell him something. As readers, we may assume Orr is giving Yossarian a chance to desert post along with Orr. The narration flashes forward to the rumored Bologna mission having been flown, and Orr being shot down and separated from his men's raft . Yossarian waits for Orr's return, fantasizing about him catching fish and navigating back to camp on his own. The chapter assures that Orr is never seen again. 

### Chapter 29: Peckem

Orr is still missing and Sergeant Whitcomb uses the chance to deploy his next-of-kin letters to Orr's family. Scheisskopf is transferred to General Peckem's control in hopes of attaining more power than General Dreedle. Peckem tells Scheisskopf a paradox "My only fault is that I have no faults", which, to his dismay, does not land well. Scheiskopf asks if he will be able to continue his parade obsession as well as move his wife to Rome with him, neither of which he is allowed. As a compromise, Peckem says he can schedule an indefinitely delayed parade and his wife can trasnfer over if she is a "Wac". General Peckem explains that they need to win a war against General Dreedle to attain more power, presence and materials. During the span of this chapter, we find Peckem to be totally self-absorbed and obsessed with sounding smart. 

> 'I've been here longer than Scheisskopf,' [Colonel Cargill] complained. 'Why cant I be the one to call of the parades?'

Cathcart's men are notified they will be bombing a defenseless village in the mountains to appease General Peckam, solely for the purpose of catching aerial photography of the bomb patterns, which is his apparent obsession. Cathcart is upset with the realization that he has direct competition in Scheisskopf and begins to mimick General Dreedle down to his idiosyncracies before he remembers that Peckam hates Dreedle. He gets very nervous but makes it through the briefing regardless, congratulating himself for performing under pressure.

### Chapter 30: Dunbar

Yossarian and Dunbar purposefully miss their marks during the bombing of civilians. During another bombing run, Yossarian has flashbacks to the mission where Snowden died and begins to spiral. McWatt is flying like a maniac despite Yossarian's begging to fly higher and more straight. Finally, he begins choking McWatt and threatens to kill him if he doesn't level out. McWatt finally listens. 

After landing, Yossarian fears that he may have lost another friend in camp, but McWatt exits the plane seemingly only concerned with Yossarian's health. A short reprise shows Yossarian hooking up with Nurse Duckett on the beach and other general R&R with the other patrol. For a moment, Yossarian has PTSD-driven fantasies of bodies floating in the water of their beach, imagining the missing Orr and Clevinger. This reprise is brought to an end by McWatt buzzing the beach before accidentally cutting Kid Sampson in half with his propeller, showering the beach with bloody debris, causing everyone to flee in a panic back to base. During the hysteria, we find out that Doc Daneeka was purportedly in the plane as per the the flight logs, though Doc is clearly in person to attest he is not in fact on the plane. Yossarian yells at McWatt to land but McWatt only continues to climb. It suddenly strikes him what McWatt is about to do, and he indeed crashes his plane into the side of a mountain in an act of suicide. Doc Daneeka is presumed dead, and Colonel Cathcart raises the number of missions to 65. 
### Chapter 31: Mrs. Daneeka

Colonel Cathcart immediately raises the required flights to 70 for the death of Doc Daneeka. Seargent Towser considers Daneeka to be yet another death on his hands next to Mudd, the dead man in Yossarian's tent. Doc Daneeka goes to have his temperature taken for a cold he is developing before learning that the enlisted men believe he is dead and are telling him as if it were fact.

>"I'm glad the little fuck is gone. I was getting sick and tired of taking his blood pressure all the time."

A funny back-and-forth occurs between Mrs. Daneeka, the War Department, and Doc Daneeka, in which a boilerplate letter is sent to her regarding the death of her husband, which causes her great sorrow, only to then to receive a letter from Doc telling her not to trust any letters from the government regarding his death. She receives one more letter assure her that her husband is dead and that his future letters will be confiscated. But this takes a turn as she learns that Doc's "death" will yield her ludicrous fortunes from a seemingly endless supply of government programs and insurance policies. Husbands of her friends begin to flirt with the new widow, and she dyes her hair. 

We return to Pianosa where Doc wonders why his wife has stopped writing, not knowing it is because her letters are returned to sender, stamped "killed in action". The men begin to resent Doc for being the source of the flight increase and effectively and he becomes a sort of pariah character, a walking, living ghost among the camp and realizes that his bureaucratic death perhaps is his true death. The irony is that Doc was forged to be on McWatt's flight by Yossarian as a means of cheating his flight time. The chapter ends with Mrs. Daneeka moving to lansing Michigan with her children and eaving no forwarding address. 

### Chapter 32: Yo-Yo's Roomies

Kid Sampson's legs are given a grisly depiction as "purple twisted wishbones" left on the beach to continue rotting because nobody will retrieve them, and they are added to the mental visuals Yossarian experiences every day. Orr's place in Yossarian's tent is replaced with 4 young, new officers who are jarringly casual in a way that seems driven by naivety rather than absurdity. They call Yossarian Yo-Yo and mess around with Orr's things to Yossarian's chagrin. He once again imagines murdering them to comfort himself. He asks Chief White Halfoat to move in to his tent but Chief decides that he is going to move to the hospital to die of pneumonia. Yossarian, perhaps sensing their naivety or seeing a younger version of himself with the young men, begins to feel protective of them. He then seems the newbies burn Orr's birch logs in the stove for warmth (presumably what they were made to do) and moves Mudd's things out of the tent (Presumably what Yossarian would have wanted, having requested just a few pages beforehand), but Yossarian is ofended by their "practical, direct efficiency" and runs away to Rome with Hungry Joe to get laid. 


### Chapter 33: Nately's Whore

Yossarian, now in Rome, is driven by his longing for Nurse Duckett to find Luciana, loving and longing for them both. In desperation, he sleeps with a number of whores including the woman with lime-green panties. He then helps play Captain Save-A-Ho with Nately, looking to rescue his love interest from two military men who are holding her captive. Their scheme involves throwing all of the rooms furnishings out the window, including the outfits of the officers holding Nately's whore imprisoned. Without their clothing, they cannot prove that they outrank Nately and Yossarian, let alone that they are not Nazis. After saving them, Nately's whore falls in love with Nately, who plans to whisk her and her sister away to America so she no longer needs to rely on prostitution. This development leads the whore to lash out against Nately, as she calls him crazy for suggesting she give up her work. The chapter ends by alluding to her missing Nately when he is away, and being angry with Yossarian for breaking Nately's nose.

### Chapter 34: Thanksgiving

The camp celebrates Thanksgiving with a massive hedonistic festival of eating and drinking of Milo's food and whiskey to the point of vomiting and fighting and passing out. Yossarian goes to sleep early but is awoken by drunk soldiers firing machine guns from Milo's crows nest into the camp. Yossarian snaps and take a revolver to charge the machine gunners. Nately goes to stop Yossarian from acting brashly, but Yossarian mistakes his identity and breaks his nose with a punch that will send him to the hospital. Dunbar then meets up with Yossarian as the gunner escape, and Dunbar shares this hear that Milo had begun attacking the squadron again. While looking for Nately, the men find the chaplain having entered the hospital with Wisconsin shingles, a disease he has made up. The novel discusses the paradox of sin and goodness in the chaplain's lie, and the further paradox in the lack of guilt the holy man holds in his lie. Now, even religion hold gray area.

Suddenly, the hospital is haunted by the return of the soldier in white, totally covered in bandages, glass beakers filling each other perfectly, and presumably empty limbs held up by pulley systems. Hysteria breaks out in the hospital and the two C.I.D men are reaveled to have been fighting each other to the point of injury, one looking for a gun to kill the other, amongst other chaotic details. Dunbar shouts that there is no solider inside the bandages and leaps onto his stretcher to prove it, but is held back by Doctors and Yossarian. Yossarian is pulled aside by Nurse Duckett who explains that Dunbar is going to be disappeared. He notes how this doesn't grammatically make sense (a problem I've always had with the phrasing). The chapter ends with Yossarian looking for Dunbar who has, in fact, been disappeared. 

### Chapter 35: Milo the Militant

It is revealed through Yossarian's first prayer that Chief White Halfoat dies of pneumonia and Nately seeks to extend his flights to buy time to win over his whore. "I've got to fly more missions or they will send me home", Nately tragically says. Milo meets with Cathcart to discuss flying missions as he feels it is not fair to the other men that he has only flown four. In a hilarious bit of dialogue, Cathcart is clearly caught off guard by how few missions Milo has flown, and is revealed to consider in real time whether or not this would count as a black eye for the Colonel. Milo explains his business practices and logistics to Cathcart, who hopes to inherit the wildly successful syndicate. As he explains a web of complex transactions, Cathcart gives up and compromises to have other men fly Milo's missions on his behalf. If another man wins a medal, Milo will receive it. If one of the men dies flying his mission, Milo will of course live. The men wake up to a new mission the next morning which kills 12 soldiers, including Dobbs and Nately. 


### Chapter 36: The Cell

The chaplain arrives at the field in which the defeated men land. After praying Nately is not one of the ones killed, he is devastated to learn Nately is. Shortly after this, the chaplain is dragged away by Seargent Whitcomb and is interrogated over a crime he cannot defend himself from. First, he is accused of forging the handwriting he has just written in real time, and is blamed for forging Washington Irving's signature, a letter Yossarian forged at the beginning of the novel. Then he is blamed for stealing a plum tomato from Colonel Cathcart who is immediately brought in to testify against this fact. He is also accused for claiming atheism isnt against the law, not being baptist (because he is anabaptist) and not knowing if atheists exist in foxholes. The colonels find the chaplain guilty in an impromptu judgement of him, and tell him to leave as they discuss his punishment. While leaving, he asks Colonel Korn for permission to speak to General Dreedle, whom the chaplain claims to have a good reputation with. Korn lets him know that Dreedle has been replaced with General Peckem who has a good reputation of Colonel Cathcart. He then lets the chaplain know that Dr. Stubbs, a doctor who was willing to ground any man with more than 70 missions, to the significantly more deadly theater in the pacific. 


### Chapter 37: General Scheisskopf

General Peckem, on his first day, learns that Scheisskopf has been promoted to Lieutenant General and supersedes him. The characters express the most distraught emotions of the book so far as they realize he will be implementing marching parades.

### Chapter 38: Kid Sister

> Yossarian marches backwards with his gun on his hip and refused to fly any more missions. He marched backward because he was continuously spinning around as he walked to make certain no one was sneaking up on him from behind. 

Yossarian opens the chapter with [[Dadaist]] imagery, marching, presumably in General Scheisskopf's parades, constantly twirling in circles on the lookout for assassin's. As we very shortly learn, he feels his life is threatened by a military who may disappear him like Dunbar as well as Nately's girl who comes to kill him for reporting Nately's death. Discussing whether to give him a break or disappear him, the Colonel's decide to send him to Rome. Nately's girl tries killing him with a potato peeler in a game of cat and mouse with a small respite in a romantic fake-out, which then introduces her kid sister materializing out of nowhere with a kitchen knife to kill Yossarian. He goes to the hospital to be treated for his blade injuries before being ambushed yet again but his assassins. In perhaps the book's most [[Looney Tunes]] moment, Yossarian tries shaking Nately's girl on multiple occassion only for her to impossibly appear once again. 

Once back on base, Yossarian is hounded by the other men who have learned that he has refused to fly even milkrun missions. They barrage him with questions of what will happen, if they will make a deal, if he will take it, and if he will be punished. He is totally dejected and only responds that he will not fly a single other mission. The chapter ends with Captain Black telling Yossarian that the whorehouse where Nately's girl and Kid Sister lived is no long there. He tells Yossarian this with a sadistic demeanor. 

### Chapter 39: The Eternal City

Yossarian flies back to Rome with Milo to search for Kid Sister and Nately's girl. Milo browbeats Yo-Yo for not flying anymore missions, likely because this means Milo's flights are not being flown. Yossarian muses on the girls wanting to kill him, ultimately understanding their position. 'Someone had to do something sometime.' 

While looking for the girls, Yossarian ends up talking to an older woman who explains that all of the whores in town have been chased away by soldiers, who imposed "Catch-22" to Yossarian's dismay. She explains that Catch-22 stated that it did not need to be shown to them to instill the injustices it demanded.

Milo takes the men to a man named Luigi who apparently deals in prostitution, who says that he will keep an eye out for the girls they seek, but that his men wil be busy moving illegal tobacco. Milo is totally sidetracked from Yossarian's humanitarian goal by the possible money to be made in illegal tobacco, and Yossarian is left on his own to walk through the grotesque streets of Rome. In one of the most dense sections of the book, he walks down streets full of teeth, watches women get raped, dogs and children get beat, and soldiers have seizures, all of which host bystanders who do not help. 

Finally, Yossarian runs into Aarfy who has just raped and killed a whore and thrown her out of a window. He freaks out and tells Aarfy that he is a deeply sinster person who is going to be arrested. Aarfy aloofly rejects that he would be arrested for something like that, especially since she is outside during a no-civilians curfew. M.P's finally burst through and arrest Yossarian for being in Rome without a visitor's permit. They apologize to Aarfy in a final gut-punch. He is taken to the two Colonel's who tell him "We're sending you home."

### Chapter 40: Catch-22

Colonel Cathcart paces around the office fuming over Yossarian while Colonel Korn returns light jabs and reminds to his interjections, saving gentler forms of communication for Yossarian. They ultimately offer him an 'odious' deal, a detail they seem to revel in, in which Yossarian will become friends with the Colonels, be promoted to Major, and will be sent home. The ultimate catch is that he must effectively become a propaganda mouthpiece so the men do no lose morale not can he allow the men to believe refusal to fly missions will get them sent home. Interestingly, another moment where leadership is seemingly caught in their own rare instance of a Catch-22. Yossarian, while initially skeptical, ultimately accepts the terms and leaves. He walks away in an airy glow, saluting a soldier he passes by, before realizing it is Nately's girl who begins stabbing him until he passes out, where the Colonel's discover him.

### Chapter 41: Snowden

Yossarian is in and out of consciousness as doctors argue over what to do with him. There's a bit of comedy regarding making incisions on the stab-wound victim, but he is ultimately put to sleep for operation. He awakens intermittently and has visions of unknown visitors who tell him "I have your friend here, pal". He then sees the chaplain come to visit him, and then sometimes Aarfy, in a dreamy stupor.  The Colonel's deal with Yossarian is then discussed, who has decided he cannot take the deal nor lie to the squadron about the Colonels or his refusal to fly missions. The chaplain lets Yossarian know that the attack on his life is being written in two parallel documents, one in which he saves the colonels from a deadly Nazi-spy attack, and another where this is ignored and he is court-martialed.

 Yossarian talks to the chaplain about the strange entity he saw in his stupor and wondered if his "pal" were his friends who have died in the war, recounting how his only alive friend is Hungry Joe. The chaplain tells Yossarian the Hungry Joe had died in his sleep, with Huple's cat sitting on his face. He is visited one more time by the strange entity who glides out of Yossarians reach, and we are suddenly transported to the flight in which Snowden dies. Yossarian helps Snowden by patching up his thigh neatly but cannot give him morphine because it is replaced by Milo with I.O.U's, in effect. Notably, the cotton is still available. The gore is explained in detail but Yossarian is surprised at his courage to deal with the flesh. Finished with the bandaging, he assure's Snowden he is going to live, before snowden points him to his shoulder which is also soaking in blood. He cuts open Snowden's jacket to which all of Snowden's organs begin to fall out of his broken ribcage, akin in a way to [[Five Holy Wounds | Jesus's Side Wound]]. This causes Yossarian to throw up and accept the futility in saving Snowden. He deploys Snowden's parachute to wrap him and comforts him into death. 

> Yosarian was cold, too, and shivering uncontrollably. He felt goos pimples clacking all over him as he gazed down despondantly at the grim secret Snowden had spilled all over the messy floor. It was easy to read the message in his entrails. Man was matter, that was Snowden's secret. Drop him out a window and he'll fall. Set fire to him and he'll burn. Bury him and he'll rot, like other kinds of garbage. The spirit gone, man is garbage. That was Snowden's secret. Ripeness was all. 



### Chapter 42: Yossarian 

In the final chapter Yossarian tells Major Danby that he cannot accept the Colonels' deal and decides to desert. The men decide that things are hopeless before the chaplain bursts in with news that Orr was found alive in neutral, progressive Sweden. Yossarian decides that he will desert his way to Sweden to meet up with Orr, realizing that Orr was trying to get him to join in desertion this entire time. The chaplain promises he will begin fighting for himself, starting by punching Captain Black in the nose. Yossarian leaves, dodging Nately's girl's attack one last time, before setting off to Sweden.
