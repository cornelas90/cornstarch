# Notes
#### Introduction
Gender is immediately identified as having a definitiion problem, not only within academic and feminist circles, but amongst right wingers who conflate it with sexuality, homosexuality, pedophilia, or femininity / womanhood. This last bit is interesting, as we know femininity is treated as a toxin in our culture that threatens heteronormative life and leads to the other 'toxins' listed. As opposed to the humanitarian crises the left is concerned with, like racial and economic injustice, climate justice, safety for queer people, etc., the right is concerned with crises of power structures: white supremacy, nationhood, christian nationalism, masculinity, etc. Butler argues that "Gender" becomes a catch-all for all anxieties.

"To be told, as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has informed the Italian and Spanish publics, that the advocates of gender will strip you of your sexed identity stokes fear and outrage among those whose sexed identity is fundamental to their very sense of who they are." Butler goes on to explain how we ought to be able to universalize the claim that having your sexed identity preserved is good and does not rely on others erasure, but the opposite takes place. 

Judith butler frequently uses the word "Phantasm" to refer to gender, and furthermore labels it a s "psychosocial phenomenon" where "intimate fears and anxieties become socially organized to incite political passion". She then goes on to quote Jean Laplanche's explanation of fantasy and its manifestation not from the imagination wholly but from real world anxieties and desires.
