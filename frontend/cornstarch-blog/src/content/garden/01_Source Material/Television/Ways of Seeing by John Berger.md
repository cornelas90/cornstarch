# Episode 1
Beginning quote by Dziga Vertov (accompanied by stills from his 1928 film *The Man with a Movie Camera*) lays out the thesis of the series, that the art we digest is tied to the position we see it from. That would be traditionally be us standing still and using our eye to view a stationary piece of art in a museum, but now means a moving camera and editing trickery to imbue a story into picture. 

Cameras reproduce pictures and paintings in any context, any location, any size, etc. "you are seeing them in the context of your own life".

Paintings within a chapel or church become integral, intertwined with the character of that building. We view it almost as a "memory" of its singular location. 

Reproductions and recontexualization of art is commodified in many forms: as a replacement for the original, as personal decor, as a way to advertise and to request donations to true museums. Imagine a flyer with a picasso advertising to visit the Art Museum in Chicago, so you may see the picasso you area already seeing in your kitchen.

Question: What has AI done to art?

The Virgin of the Rocks by Leonard Da Vinci example shows two museums: The lourve and the national museum of english, both with extensive written histories of ownership of the piece to justify its genuine nature. 

A Leonardo purchased by 'the Americans' for millions of dollars becomes like 'a relic in a holy shrine', kept in the dark and away from people. It takes on a new property of mystique because of its perceived market value which is dependent upon its authenticity.

Art is to be stripped of false mystery and false religiosity to find deeper appreciation. 'This religiosity, usually linked with cash value, but always invoked in the name of culture or civilization, is a substitute for what paintings lost when the camera made them reproducible.' See [[Commodification of Art]]

In other words, we have created a climate in which art can only be appreciated for what we perceive as its genuine nature, and thus its value. We say 'wow, its the real thing.' which transmutes into 'wow it's so expensive'. This MUST be the source of awe because these emotions are not drawn from us when we see reproductions even at the highest level of facsimile. 

Question to self: So what do you say when you hang some classic painting on your wall?

Transmittance of art has destroyed original context and meaning of art, but created many replacements. But stillness and silence remain, both of which remain striking as well. In part because they welcome us to view the art. Also in part by allowing connection between the view in its own place with the moment the art captures. 

Art is manipulated by movement and sound (or cropping) and changes its meaning. The program shows a closeup of one female figure in a painting which changes the context of the image we view from allegory to pure beauty. This is strangely quite like taking a famous scene or still from a piece of media and making it your avatar. 

"In paintings, there is no unfolding time". Large piece of art may showcase concepts which we expect to unfurl, but it cannot physically unfurl for us. 

The context of a painting may be imbued with emotion, manipulating the viewer into seeing whatever the manipulator pleases. In this example, we are told that the artwork shown is the last of Van Gogh before he has killed himself, and somber violin music plays. We now transmute the art itself into being somber. Without that detail or the music, this somberness is still tangible but perhaps not as easily as with the massaging provided.

In the next example, italian opera and movement across Caravaggio is used to imply a heated discussion is taking place. When the music is replaced with religious choral music, we suddenly feel as if we are about to see a divine act or spiritual stupor. IN neither example are we provided context for the original meaning of the piece. 

In the final example, a Goya is shown with 'information' as a form of manipulation. A smash cut of british teenyboppers dancing with the man being executed is absurd and comedic. The same goya crashcut with real men being executed by firing squad is disturbing and a stark reminder of the violence of the real world. It is no longer absurd and comedic, in fact we may feel bad about laughing about it in retrospect. Berger describes this as the 'impact' being modified.

In a similar way, the program suggests that information directly pertaining to art by ways of context or expert analysis act as a barrier between us and the art. It is almost to say "you cannot communicate back and forth with this art. you need a translator."

# Episode 2
"Men dream of women. Women dream of themselves being dreamt of. Men look at women, women watch themselves being looked at."

"From childhood she is taught to survey herself continually... everything she is and does.... How she appears to other, specifically men, is crucial importance for what is thought of as the success of her life."

"A Nude has to be seen as an object in order to be a nude". This is as opposed to being naked, which is to be solely ones self. See [[Nudity vs. Nakedness]]

The mirror held by a nude woman becomes a symbol of vanity, a vanity forced onto women by the leering of men. This puts the blame of nudity onto the woman despite its creation existing for men. "Thus incidentally repeating the biblical example by blaming the woman." This hypocrisy is also found in [[Machismo]] and [[Marianismo]] culture. 

PERSONAL NOTE: There may be a future connection to [[Divine Femininity]] as well, since all of the given examples of nudes are contexualized as religious images.

"Her nakedness is not a sign of her own feelings, it's only a sign of her submission to his demand."

The viewer of a nude painting or image becomes a second or third participant in the art, but the woman very often acknowledges the viewer over a lover or other character. And often the womans body is positioned for display to the viewer as opposed to a posture that makes sense for her scene. "She has no appetite of her own, she only feeds the appetite of the viewer"

The first woman they speak to talks about the idealization of the female body in european paintings with enlarged secondary sexual characteristics, and how impossible it is to connect with them. In contrast, she says that a photograph is, while still unlikely to represent 'her' specifically, still has a spirit of herself she can connect to. Funnily enough, with the advent of plastic surgery, it seems this gap has widedened. 

"Nudity is a uniform: 'I'm ready now for sexual pleasure.'"

Availability and passivity as an antithesis of action and dynamism which is seen as power and unfeminine. 

Men derive their sense of self from the world. Women derive their sense of self from man. Man makes decisions on the strata of social heirarchy, power, capital, commodity. If women seek this same derivation of self, they usually do so through a man (gold diggers) and are thus seen as snakey and untrustworthy. They are not allowed to seek these things the way men do, because this puts other gods in front of their natural godliness and familial priorities. 

"What women envy in men is a sense of their own identity. That there is something in them that they derive worth from other than what others think of them."

There is an important tie between nudity and pose and more generally self-reflection and pose that is quite interesting. One lady mentions how you may pose while in front of a mirror and try your best to create the image you want to make, whereas other moments where you accidentally see a reflection you may be caught off guard by a truer image of yourself. I really like this detail and will try to remember it for my story. 

# Episode 3
This episode begins pointing out that oil paintings frequently showcase some other object, and that owning such painting is like owning the object. 

It then quickly switches to music and begins to explain the flexible ideaology that accompanies art much in the same way Zizek does in *A Pervert's Guide to Ideology*. This is done to point out the dangers of 'the love of art' as its own strength or religiosity. 

An oil painting example of 2 french diplomats in London, both standing amongst scientific tools, a lute, a globe, all to depict science and culture, more than anything, showcases their wealth. The wealth becomes the foremost important subject. This subject also has the notorious memento mori in it, interesting enough. 

During the age of the oil painting, merchandise (and perhaps pleasure itself) became a subject worth painting, for the first time ever. to paint over divinity or social heirarchy. If it werent objets d'art, fruit, merchandise, pedigree livestock, property, or houses, it was those whom owned all of these things. And their ancestors. "Every portrait says 'I once existed and looked like this' or furthermore 'I am wealthy and can summon attention by raising my hand'."

# Episode 4
Advertising is a combination of language and images which call out to us and show us an alternate reality.

In days of stronger heirarchical structures, 'glamour' as we know it today did not exist. Ideas of grace, elegance, authority amount to somehting similar. When our place in society is is determined at birth, personal envy is less familiar.

The oil painting shows what the wealthy already owns but it never showed the exploitation that lead to his wealth. Advertising shows what we aspire to (or think we aspire to) but have not achieved (and will not achieve). 

Publicity promises and threatens. plays upon fear, and the fear of being unenviable. You are inadequate as you are, but consoles you with the promise that it is fixable. And that dream is created in factories by people just like you. See [[Commodity Fetishism]]. Advertising is a obfuscation between you and workers wherein your attention interacts with image and text and they converse with each other to convince you to use your money to go be traded for an object.

Personal Note: Research [[Attention Economy]]. 

Ideaology is injected in our commodities. "Revolution" paired with an item suggest some new idea, but uses violent language. THis episode juxtaposes an article about refugees from pakistan with the next page being about gin drinks and the importance of drinking something dry when everything else is so sweet. Everything is given the same weight and those nothing is meaningful.
