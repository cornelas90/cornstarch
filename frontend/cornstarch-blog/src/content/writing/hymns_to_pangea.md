Your death was inspired  
By what life could be  
Vignettes will run closer  
The more that you see  
Mantras and song  
Were made to affirm  
Horticulture tells  
Of inevitable return.

To the Other.  
The Aether.  
The World.  
The Worms.

The churches will speak  
In medium truths  
A savior from debt  
Is a creditor too  
Mantras and song  
Were written for you  
Choose what to think  
But think it all through.

Our minds are well trained  
In patterns of three  
Yet life will slip cadence,  
With relative ease.  
And now it would seem  
One song written for me  
Like hymns to Pangea  
Sunken to sea.
