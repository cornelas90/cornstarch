Cloudscapes, so incensed  
Thunderheads that erase  
Revoke father Sol 
Of his warming embrace  
Colors run cold  
Oppressive. Christ.  
Rainbows and earth tones  
Flee Catastrophe's race.  

It will happen here,  
Fluorescent abuse.  
Shine surgically clear  
They, obscurers of truth  
Paint white veneers  
Over crumbling wood.  
It has happened here  
Like slow, noxious fumes.  

Earthly submission  
Forest nevergreen  
Fields fleeting fever  
No soul intervenes   
Oceans a flame  
Fuel for the machine  
Its Motor's black plumes  
Reach and pray to the obscene.  

Still.  

We seek our blue skies  
And colorful fish  
And earthy green pines  
With their slow, wooden drift.  
Divine, tilled and kept  
Not subdued or imposed.  
We still exist  
If our hearts never close.
