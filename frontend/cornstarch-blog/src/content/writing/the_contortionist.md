Behold.  
Watch as I,  
The Contortionist,  
God's creation,  
Twist and crack  
Directionless limbs  
That beseech above.  
Joints grasping the ground  
Opposing the void  
For what else is left?  
I will continue - Watch.  
How I fold at the waist  
And let my hips hook in  
Underneath my ribs.  
I Pry apart slow  
My creaking chest  
Like a flower in bloom,  
Boney white petals  
My heart is a pistil.  
Awaiting lost wisps  
Of passing love.  
My body a cage  
And somewhere inside  
A voice lost of speech.  
But my jaw knocks loose  
I bite and I gnash  
Until my teeth intertwine.  
Like drunkard dovetails  
In parallax grind  
Unwilled to go on  
Past familiar pain  
And forever unlatch  
My tongue.  
My hand.  
My heart.
